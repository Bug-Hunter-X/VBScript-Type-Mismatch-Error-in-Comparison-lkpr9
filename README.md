This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in VBScript that occurs when comparing variables of different data types. The `bug.vbs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to compare a numeric value with a string value directly within an If-ElseIf-Else conditional structure. The solution involves explicitly converting the variables to the same data type before the comparison to prevent the type mismatch error.
